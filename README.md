# .NET GC Generations Demo  

This project is a simple **C# .NET console application** that demonstrates how the **.NET Garbage Collector (GC)** works across different generations (Gen 0, Gen 1, Gen 2).  

It shows:  
- How objects are allocated in generations.  
- How objects get promoted when GC runs.  
- How to force garbage collection for a specific generation.  
- How to check GC collection counts.

##  How It Works  

- **Gen 0** → Newly created short-lived objects (e.g., small variables, temp references).  
- **Gen 1** → Middle-aged objects that survived at least one GC.  
- **Gen 2** → Long-lived objects (e.g., static references, large arrays).  

This demo forces collection on each generation separately and prints results:  
- Object generation before and after collection.  
- Memory usage.  
- Collection counts with `GC.CollectionCount()`.

##  GC Generations Diagram  
```
+-----------------+ +-----------------+ +-----------------+
| Generation 0 | ---> | Generation 1 | ---> | Generation 2 |
| Short-lived | | Survived 1 GC | | Long-lived |
| objects | | (promoted) | | objects |
+-----------------+ +-----------------+ +-----------------+
```

- Objects start in **Gen 0**.  
- If they survive a collection, they move to **Gen 1**.  
- If they survive more collections, they move to **Gen 2**.  
- Gen 2 collections are the most expensive.

##  Run the Project  

Make sure you have **.NET 8 SDK** (or newer) installed.  

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/GCGenerationsDemo.git
cd GCGenerationsDemo

# Run project
dotnet run
